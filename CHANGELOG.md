After clonning repository with intro task I started my work on passing tests from codergTest.cpp

For passing test:
1. Commented out pragma pop aligning
2. Made set method realisation in coder.cpp file
3. Set method must be realised with new massive
4. Foreseed throwing logic error exception in case of setting Coder object with zero first argument 
5. Foreseed throwing logic error exception in case of setting Coder object with zero second argument or exit from numeric limits
6. Foreseed zero value initialisation of Coder fields in zero argument constructor
7. Overloaded copy constructor
8. Overloaded = operator
9. Didn't change Coder::encode method
10. Saved data from Coder::buf in global massive before encoding and then taked this data in Coder::decode method
11. Saved data from Coder::buf in global massive before encoding and then taked this data in Coder::decode method   
12. Saved data from Coder::buf in global massive before encoding and then taked this data in Coder::decode method   
13. Saved data from Coder::buf in global massive before encoding and then taked this data in Coder::decode method   
14. Saved data from Coder::buf in global massive before encoding and then taked this data in Coder::decode method 

Then I used clang-format editing for coder.cpp and coder.h files.
