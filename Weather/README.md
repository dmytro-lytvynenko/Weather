# Weather monitoring application

## Assignment
Write a realization for weather conditions monitoring using OpenWeatherMap API and components from Boost library.

The program is divided into 3 modules:
- `network` - is responsible for connecting to the external server, sending a request, and receiving a response.
- `client` - is responsible for passing data to `network`, processing results from it, and printing results on a screen.
- `application` - is responsible for processing command-line arguments and passing them to `client`.

The program must be capable of:
- Showing help (as shown in `application.hpp`), if no arguments present or it was `-h` or `--help` argument;
- Reading city from the console;
- Reading token from console (If not present, check the file `token.txt` in the same directory as executable). Remember, token - is your secret information.
- Showing information about the weather in specified city. (as shown in `application.hpp`):
    - Name of the city
    - Temperature (degree Celsius)
    - Wind velocity (meters per second)
    - Wind direction (degrees)
- Connection to the server:
    - Reading host - `api.openweathermap.org` (must be set as default)
    - Reading port - `80` (must be set as default)
- Correct behavior when it can't connect to the server:
    - Prints `"Can't reach server"` when a connection could not be established
    - Prints `"Can't get weather in %city_name%"` when a city does not exist
    - Does not terminate with a non-zero error code in other cases

For header files, only appending is allowed.\
`main.cpp` is forbidden for modification.\
Must use Boost.Asio and Boost.Beast to work with the network, and Boost.Program to handle command-line arguments.\
Must use CMake to build the application. Name of the program must be `Weather`.\
`.gitlab-ci.yml` is forbidden for modification.

### Receiving a token
1. Open the following site: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up
2. Sing up there
3. In the purpose field select "Education/science"
4. Check your email, open letter, and press "Verify"
5. Your API will be here: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
6. Read the API doc: https://openweathermap.org/current

### Setting up a pipeline
1. Move .gitlab-ci.yml into the repository root folder.
2. In the last commit move it back into Weather folder. This commit must contain only changes in the confing file.
Do not spam Gitlab-runner!

## Maintainer

#### Preconditions

### Test cases
- [ ] Shows help
- [ ] Can read city from a console
- [ ] Can read token from a console
- [ ] Can read token from a file
- [ ] Prints weather in existing city
- [ ] Uses default address and port, can select other address and port
- [ ] Prints correct message when a connection could not be established
- [ ] Prints correct message when a city does not exist
- [ ] Always finishes with exit code 0

### Code review
Technologies used:
- [ ] CMake for building
- [ ] boost::asio
- [ ] boost::beast
- [ ] boost::program

Style:
- [ ] No raw pointers used and no potential memory leaks exist
- [ ] Potential errors are wrapped in try-catch
- [ ] Header guards are present

Task requirements:
- [ ] Only additions are present in header files
